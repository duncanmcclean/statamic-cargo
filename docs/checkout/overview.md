It's all well and good having a website listing your products, but if your customers can't actually buy anything, then what's the point?

Cargo includes a **pre-built checkout flow** - featuring a minimal design and flexible Antlers templates, making it easy to customise for your project.

If you wish, you can also build your own checkout flow from scratch, using nothing but Cargo's Antlers tags.

Either way, you can find documentation on both approaches below.
