title: Payment Gateways
---

## Configuration
You can configure the available payment gateways in your `cargo.php` config file. 

Gateways often have things like API keys, or other options you may need to provide, which you can do in the config array.

```php
// config/statamic/cargo.php

'payments' => [  
    'gateways' => [  
        'dummy' => [  
            //  
        ],
  
//        'stripe' => [  
//            'key' => env('STRIPE_KEY'),  
//            'secret' => env('STRIPE_SECRET'),  
//            'webhook_secret' => env('STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET'),  
//        ],  
  
//		  'mollie' => [  
//		      'api_key' => env('MOLLIE_KEY'),  
//		      'profile_id' => env('MOLLIE_PROFILE_ID'),  
//		  ],
	],
],
``` 

Sensitive values should be stored in your `.env` file, which should be ignored by Git.

## Dummy
Like the name suggests, the Dummy payment gateway exists to make it easy to get up and running with Cargo, without fussing about setting up and configuring a payment gateway.

### Payment Form
:::tip Note
You don't need to copy this into your project if you're using the [built-in checkout flow](/docs/checkout), as you'll already have it.
:::

To use the Dummy gateway, copy and paste this template into your checkout flow:

```antlers
<form action="{{ checkout_url }}" method="POST">
	<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 mb-4">
		<input type="text" name="cardholder" placeholder="Name on Card" value="{{ cart:customer:name }}" required>
		<input type="text" name="card_number" placeholder="Card Number" value="4242 4242 4242 4242" required>
		<input type="text" name="card_expiry" placeholder="Expiry" value="{{ now format="m" }}/{{ now format="y" | add:1 }}" required>
		<input type="text" name="card_cvc" placeholder="CVC" value="123" required>
	</div>
	
	<button>Pay Now</button>
</form>
``` 

## Stripe
### Payment Form
:::tip Note
You don't need to copy this into your project if you're using the [built-in checkout flow](/docs/checkout), as you'll already have it.
:::

To use the Stripe gateway, copy and paste this template into your checkout flow:

```antlers
{{# You should really load this in your <head> if possible. #}}
<script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>

<form id="payment-form">
    <div id="payment-element" class="mb-4">
        <!--Stripe.js injects the Payment Element-->
    </div>
    <button id="submit" class="bg-blue-400 text-white uppercase font-semibold px-4 py-2">Pay Now</button>
    <div id="payment-message" class="hidden"></div>
</form>

<script>
    // This is a public sample test API key.
    // Donâ€™t submit any personally identifiable information in requests made with this key.
    // Sign in to see your own test API key embedded in code samples.
    const stripe = Stripe("{{ api_key }}");

    let elements;

    initialize();

    document
        .querySelector("#payment-form")
        .addEventListener("submit", handleSubmit);

    // Fetches a payment intent and captures the client secret
    async function initialize() {
        elements = stripe.elements({ clientSecret: '{{ client_secret }}' });

        const paymentElementOptions = {
            layout: "accordion",
            defaultValues: {
                billingDetails: {
                    name: '{{ cart:customer:name }}',
                    email: '{{ cart:customer:email }}',
                    address: {
                        line1: '{{ cart:billing_line_1 }}',
                        line2: '{{ cart:billing_line_2 }}',
                        city: '{{ cart:billing_city }}',
                        postal_code: '{{ cart:billing_postcode }}',
                        state: '{{ cart:billing_state:code }}',
                        country: '{{ cart:billing_country:iso2 }}',
                    },
                },
            },
        };

        const paymentElement = elements.create("payment", paymentElementOptions);
        paymentElement.mount("#payment-element");
    }

    async function handleSubmit(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        setLoading(true);

        const { error } = await stripe.confirmPayment({
            elements,
            confirmParams: {
            // Make sure to change this to your payment completion page
            return_url: "{{ checkout_url }}",
            },
        });

        // This point will only be reached if there is an immediate error when
        // confirming the payment. Otherwise, your customer will be redirected to
        // your `return_url`. For some payment methods like iDEAL, your customer will
        // be redirected to an intermediate site first to authorize the payment, then
        // redirected to the `return_url`.
        if (error.type === "card_error" || error.type === "validation_error") {
            showMessage(error.message);
        } else {
            showMessage("An unexpected error occurred.");
        }

        setLoading(false);
    }

    // ------- UI helpers -------

    function showMessage(messageText) {
        const messageContainer = document.querySelector("#payment-message");

        messageContainer.classList.remove("hidden");
        messageContainer.textContent = messageText;

        setTimeout(function () {
            messageContainer.classList.add("hidden");
            messageContainer.textContent = "";
        }, 4000);
    }

    function setLoading(isLoading) {
        document.getElementById('submit').disabled = isLoading;
    }
</script>
``` 

We're using Stripe's [Payment Elements implementation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart), which allows customers to choose from any of the payment methods enabled in your account.

You may wish to disable the "Link" payment method, as it can sometimes get in the way. It can be disabled from the [Payment Methods](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/payment_methods) settings page in the Stripe Dashboard.

If possible, you should move Stripe's JS into the `<head>`.

### Webhooks
Cargo relies on webhooks sent by Stripe to capture payments, update order statuses and handle refunds.

The easiest way to receive webhooks locally is by using the [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli). Once you've got it setup, all you need to do is run this command any time you want to listen for events:

```
stripe listen --forward-to https://your-store.test/!/cargo/payments/stripe/webhook --skip-verify
``` 

When you setup your site on production, you can should create a webhook in the Stripe Dashboard. 

It should point to `https://your-store.com/!/cargo/payments/stripe/webhook`, and listen for any charge or payment intent events:

![Screenshot of setting up a webhook in the Stripe dashboard](/images/stripe-setup-webhook.png)

For additional security, we recommend copying the "Webhook Secret" into your `.env` file:

```
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

## Mollie
### Payment Form
:::tip Note
You don't need to copy this into your project if you're using the [built-in checkout flow](/docs/checkout), as you'll already have it.
:::

Since the transaction happens on Mollie's website, all we need to do is take the customer there, which makes the payment form incredibly simple:

```antlers
<a href="{{ checkout_url }}">
	Checkout with Mollie
</a>
```

### Webhooks
Cargo relies on webhooks sent by Mollie in order to update order statuses and handle refunds. 

When the payment gateway creates the payment in Mollie, it automatically configures the webhook URL for us.

However, when you're developing locally, your local development site won't be accessible by Mollie in order for it to send webhook requests.

You can workaround this by setting up a tunneling service, like [Expose](https://expose.dev) or [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com), which will provide you with a publicly accessible URL that Mollie can use to talk with your local dev site.

You will need to update the `APP_URL` key in your `.env` while your tunnel is active, so the gateway points towards the tunnel.

## Build your own
If you need to use a payment processor that Cargo doesn't support out-of-the-box, it's pretty easy to build your own payment gateway.

To get started, run the following command:

```
php please make:payment-gateway FooPay
```

This will create a file in `app/PaymentMethods` which looks like this:

```php
<?php  
  
namespace App\PaymentGateways;  
  
use DuncanMcClean\Cargo\Contracts\Cart\Cart;  
use DuncanMcClean\Cargo\Contracts\Orders\Order;  
use DuncanMcClean\Cargo\Payments\Gateways\PaymentGateway;  
use Illuminate\Http\Request;  
use Illuminate\Http\Response;
  
class FooPay extends PaymentGateway  
{  
    public function setup(Cart $cart): array  
    {  
        return [];  
    }  
  
    public function process(Order $order): void  
    {  
        //
    }  
  
    public function capture(Order $order): void  
    {  
        //  
    }  
  
    public function cancel(Cart $cart): void  
    {  
        //  
    }  
  
    public function webhook(Request $request): Response  
    {  
        return response();  
    }  
  
    public function refund(Order $order, int $amount): void  
    {  
		// ...
		
        $order->set('amount_refunded', $amount)->save();  
    }  
}
``` 

Cargo will automatically register any payment gateways in the `app/PaymentGateways` directory. 

If your payment gateways live elsewhere or you're inside of an addon, you will need to register it manually in a service provider:

```php
// app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php

use App\PaymentGateways\FooPay;

public function boot(): void
{
	FooPay::register();
}
```
### Methods
#### `setup`
This method is called by the `{{ payment_gateways }}` tag (or its [AJAX equivalent](/docs/json-api#available-payment-gateways)).

You should do whatever you need to do to create the "payment". Anything you return from this method will be available on the checkout form.

:::tip Note
Please ensure that sensitive API keys aren't returned by this method, as they could be exposed using the AJAX endpoint.
:::

#### `process`
This method is called when the payment gateway's "checkout URL" is hit.

#### `capture`
When your payment gateway supports "authorise and capture", you can call this method in your webhook code to capture the payment.

This method can be left blank when "authorise and capture" isn't supported.

#### `cancel`
This method is called when the payment gateway's "checkout URL" is hit, but the payment needs to be cancelled.

Payments may need to be cancelled when a coupon is invalid, there's not enough stock to fulfil the order, or customer/address information is missing from the order.

#### `webhook`
This method is called when a webhook request is received.

When possible, you should verify that the request is genuine before taking action (eg. by verifying headers).

#### `refund`
This method is called when a refund is initiated in the Control Panel.

#### `fieldtypeDetails`
If you want to, you can add a `fieldtypeDetails` method to your payment gateway, allowing you to display information about the transaction in the Control Panel, under the "Payment" tab.

```php
public function fieldtypeDetails(Order $order): array  
{  
	return [
		__('Payment ID') => $order->get('payment_id'),
		__('Card Brand') => 'Mastercard',
		__('Card Last Four') => '4242',
	];
}
```

### Notes
* Every payment gateway has a unique checkout URL...
	* You can either submit to this URL using a `<form>` tag or use it as a redirect/callback URL, depending on your needs.
* Every payment gateway has a unique webhook URL...
	* It takes the format of `/!/cargo/payments/gateway_handle/webhook`. 
* Where possible, if your gateway supports it, we recommend separating the authorisation and capture steps of the payment.
* If you're in need of inspiration, feel free to look at Cargo's [Stripe](https://github.com/duncanmcclean/cargo/blob/main/src/Payments/Gateways/Stripe.php) and [Mollie](https://github.com/duncanmcclean/cargo/blob/main/src/Payments/Gateways/Mollie.php) payment gateways.
