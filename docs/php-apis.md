title: PHP APIs

This guide will hopefully give you a rough idea of how things work, and details on what methods are available, in order to help you when writing custom code to interact with Cargo.

If you can't find what you're looking for here, you may want to consider source-diving the code (it's really not as bad as you think), or ask for help on [GitHub](https://github.com/duncanmcclean/statamic-cargo/discussions).

## Carts
The `Cart` facade allows you to query, create and update carts. 

### Querying
#### Get a single cart by its ID
You can use the `find` method to get a single cart:

```php
use DuncanMcClean\Cargo\Facades\Cart;

Cart::find(123);
``` 

The `find` method will return `null` when the cart can't be found. If you'd prefer an exception to be thrown, you can use the `findOrFail` method.

#### Get the current cart
If you're in the context of a web request, you can call the `current()` method to obtain the customer's current cart instance.

```php
use DuncanMcClean\Cargo\Facades\Cart;

Cart::current();
``` 

#### Querying all carts
You can use the facade's `query()` method to query your store's carts.

```php
use DuncanMcClean\Cargo\Facades\Cart;

Cart::query()
  ->where('site', 'english')
  ->where('customer', $userId)
  ->get();
``` 

You can learn more about query builders, and the available methods, on the [Statamic documentation](https://statamic.dev/content-queries).

### Creating
Start by making an instance of a cart with the `make` method. 

```php
use DuncanMcClean\Cargo\Facades\Cart;

Cart::make();
``` 

You may call additional methods on the cart to customise it further:

```php
$cart
  ->site('english')
  ->customer($userId)
  ->customer(['name' => 'John Doe', 'email' => 'john@example.com']) // For guest customers
  ->coupon($coupon)
  ->lineItems([
	  [
		  'product' => 'abc',
		  'quantity' => 1,
	  ],
	  [
		  'product' => 'efg',
		  'quantity' => 2,
	  ],
  ]);
```

Finally, save it. It'll return a boolean for whether it succeeded or not.

```php
$cart->save();
```

:::tip Note
Cargo will automatically recalculate the cart's totals when you `->save()`. If you wish to save the cart *without* recalculating, you should call `->saveWithoutRecalculating()` instead.

#### Methods
There's a bunch of handy methods on the `Cart` object. For completeness, here's a big old table:

## Orders
The `Order` facade allows you to query, create and update orders. 

### Querying
#### Get a single order by its ID
You can use the `find` method to get a single order:

```php
use DuncanMcClean\Cargo\Facades\Order;

Order::find(123);
``` 

The `find` method will return `null` when the order can't be found. If you'd prefer an exception to be thrown, you can use the `findOrFail` method.

#### Querying all orders
You can use the facade's `query()` method to query your store's orders.

```php
use DuncanMcClean\Cargo\Facades\Order;

Order::query()
  ->where('site', 'english')
  ->where('customer', $userId)
  ->get();
``` 

You can learn more about query builders, and the available methods, on the [Statamic documentation](https://statamic.dev/content-queries).

### Creating
Start by making an instance of an order with the `make` method. 

```php
use DuncanMcClean\Cargo\Facades\Order;

Order::make();
``` 

You may call additional methods on the cart to customise it further:

```php
$order
  ->orderNumber(12345)
  ->status('shipped')
  ->date('2025-04-07')
  ->site('english')
  ->customer($userId)
  ->customer(['name' => 'John Doe', 'email' => 'john@example.com']) // For guest customers
  ->coupon($coupon)
  ->lineItems([
	  [

#### Methods
There's a bunch of handy methods on the `Order` object. For completeness, here's a big old table:

| Method                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Products
Since products are just entries, you can use the [Entry Repository](https://statamic.dev/repositories/entry-repository) and the associated `Entry` class to work with products.

### Product Variants
If you need to add product variants programatically (maybe for a custom importer), you should first create an example product, add a couple of options/variants to see how it gets saved.

Then, in your custom code, you should try and construct the array using the same format.
