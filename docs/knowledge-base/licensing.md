Cargo is a **paid** Statamic addon.

It's not my full time job, but maintaining and supporting it still takes up a fair chunk of my time, so payment is only fair.

Cargo costs $199 for new licences, then $85 per year thereafter for support & updates, similar to Statamic itself.

You can use Cargo for free while in development. You only need to purchase a licence when your site goes live. 

Licences can be purchased from the [Statamic Marketplace](https://statamic.com/addons/duncanmcclean/cargo).

## Simple Commerce customers
If you've purchased Simple Commerce **within the last 12 months**, you can migrate to Cargo for free.

Otherwise, you purchased Simple Commerce **more than a year ago**, you can migrate to Cargo for $85 (the annual update fee).

Either way, just email [support@builtwithcargo.dev](support@builtwithcargo.dev) with your order number, and I'll send you a coupon code to use at checkout.
