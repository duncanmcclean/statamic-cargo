This guide will hopefully give you a rough idea of how things work, and details on what methods are available, in order to help you when writing custom code to interact with Cargo.

If you can't find what you're looking for here, you may want to consider source-diving the code (it's really not as bad as you think), or ask for help on [GitHub](https://github.com/duncanmcclean/statamic-cargo/discussions).
