title: "JSON API: Introduction"

When the `<form>` tag just doesn't cut it anymore, Cargo provides a JSON API allowing you to interact with the cart in a more flexible way.

You can do everything you would normally do with the form tags, but just with JSON instead. Particularly useful if you don't want a page reload after submitting forms.
