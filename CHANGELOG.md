# Changelog

## v1.0.0-alpha.1 (2025-05-02)

This is the first **alpha release** of **Cargo**, the successor to Simple Commerce! ðŸš€

For now, there's only a handful of folks in this repo, ahead of a full public release when Statamic 6 reaches alpha. If you're reading this, it probably means you're one of the lucky few. I really appreciate your time and feedback!

To get started, check out the [Alpha Notes](https://builtwithcargo.dev/docs/alpha-notes).
